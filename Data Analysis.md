<h1>Data Analysis Report</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>

This report details a decision tree analysis to determine the optimal drug line development strategy for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) amidst market uncertainty and new competition. The central objective of this analysis is to determine which strategy, new drug development or existing drug modification, will maximize expected financial value for MPC. Decision tree analysis was chosen to evaluate potential outcomes, probabilities, and payoffs for three actions: new drug development, existing drug modification, and no change. This report will justify this method, present relevant data and the decision tree diagram, explain expected value calculations, discuss limitations, and recommend a primary and backup course of action to guide MPC's strategic decision-making.


<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<h3>Data & Methodology</h3>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>

  - <b>Business Question Framing:</b> Clearly defines the core business problem of selecting the most financially viable drug line strategy under uncertainty.
  - <b>Decision Tree Methodology:</b> Justifies the use of decision tree analysis due to identifiable decision alternatives, possible states of nature, associated probabilities, and quantifiable payoffs.
  - <b>Data Analysis:</b> Presents relevant data values including profit per unit, favorable and unfavorable demand, success probabilities, and calculated payoffs for each strategic option.
  - <b>Visual Representation:</b> Includes a detailed decision tree diagram illustrating the decision nodes, state-of-nature nodes, payoffs, and expected values for each branch.
  - <b>Expected Value Calculation:</b> Details the step-by-step calculation of expected values for each strategy, demonstrating how weighted averages of potential financial outcomes are derived.
  - <b>Limitations Assessment:</b> Discusses the limitations of the analysis, including assumptions made regarding unfavorable market demand for certain strategies and the inherent simplification of real-world complexities by the decision tree model.
  - <b>Strategic Recommendation:</b> Provides a primary and backup course of action based on the calculated expected values, recommending the modification of the existing drug line as the optimal strategy.

<h3>Outcome</h3>

The analysis strongly recommends that MPC prioritize the modification of its existing drug line, as it yielded the highest expected financial value of $3,870.02.  This project provides a clear, data-backed strategic direction for MPC to navigate competitive market conditions and maximize potential returns.
