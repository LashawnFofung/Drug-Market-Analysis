# Project: Drug-Market-Analysis

# Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive decision tree analysis conducted for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) to determine the optimal drug line development strategy amidst market uncertainty and new competition. The analysis evaluates three strategic options: developing a new drug, modifying an existing drug, and maintaining the current approach. By quantifying potential outcomes, probabilities, and financial payoffs, this project provides a data-driven recommendation to maximize MPC's expected financial value.
