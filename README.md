# Drug-Market-Analysis

# Project Description

This report details a decision tree analysis to determine the optimal drug line development strategy for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) amidst market uncertainty and new competition. The central objective of this analysis is to determine which strategy, new drug development or existing drug modification, will maximize expected financial value for MPC. Decision tree analysis was chosen to evaluate potential outcomes, probabilities, and payoffs for three actions: new drug development, existing drug modification, and no change. This report will justify this method, present relevant data and the decision tree diagram, explain expected value calculations, discuss limitations, and recommend a primary and backup course of action to guide MPC's strategic decision-making.
